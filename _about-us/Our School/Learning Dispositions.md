<p><strong>OUR COR2E LEARNING DISPOSITIONS</strong>
</p>
<p>There are 5 key learning dispositions that we seek to develop in every
student: Curiosity, Open-mindedness, Responsibility, Resilience and Enthusiasm
(COR2E). These Learning dispositions are positive behaviours and attitudes
towards learning which we strive to imbue in our children. They are important
for the children in their journey as life-long learners.</p>
