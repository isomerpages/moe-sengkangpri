Our Parent Support Group (PSG) plays a significant role in bringing parents together, promoting a collaborative relationship between parents and the school. They are made up of parents who are dedicated to support our school in the holistic development of our students. They contribute their time, effort and talent to support the school’s programmes and initiatives. The PSG is managed by an Executive Committee (EXCO).

The PSG complements the school by aligning with the school’s objectives, supporting and strengthening the school’s programmes to improve our children’s well-being and learning. The PSG listens to parents’ feedback on school operations, practices and programmes, and provides feedback to the school. The PSG also facilitates the school’s communication to parents.
