<p><strong>Welcome to 2026</strong>
</p>
<p>A warm welcome to the new year at Seng Kang Primary School! As we step
into 2026, I am filled with excitement and gratitude for the vibrant community
that makes our school a special place.</p>
<p>Since our founding, we have remained steadfast to three core beliefs that
define who we are: <strong>Everyone can learn, Everyone can serve, and Everyone is Special</strong>.
These beliefs are not merely words—they are the heartbeat of everything
we do. Just as our school crest symbolises each SKLite and staff member
as a precious gem, we remain committed to cherishing and developing every
individual in our care.</p>
<p><strong>Our Refreshed Vision, Mission and Values</strong>
</p>
<p>As we embark on this exciting new chapter, guided by MOE’s Desired Outcomes
of Education and 21st Century Competencies, we are committed to nurturing
future ready learners equipped with the skills, knowledge and grounded
in values, enabling our SKLites to embrace the opportunities and challenges
that lie ahead.</p>
<p>I am delighted to share our refreshed vision: <strong>'Thinkers today, Leaders tomorrow.'</strong> This
evolution builds upon the strong foundation of our previous vision, which
has successfully guided our SKLites towards success over the years. Our
mission: <strong>Nurturing future-ready learners and developing future leaders with the passion </strong>reflects
our commitment to curate meaningful school programmes that shape positive
learning attitudes and mindsets throughout their six-year journey with
SKPS. Through the intentional design of learning experiences, both within
and beyond the classroom, we prepare our SKLites to be self-directed and
adaptable, and leaders who serve with purpose in our school, community,
and nation.</p>
<p>Our school values have also been refreshed to <strong>RICE</strong>—<strong>Respect, Integrity, Care, and Excellence</strong>.
These values will anchor our SKLites as they navigate their educational
journey and beyond, equipping them to thrive in an ever-changing world.</p>
<p>Central to our approach are our four key learning dispositions, which
we call <strong>CORE</strong>: <strong>Curiosity</strong> to explore and question, <strong>Open-mindedness</strong> to
embrace diverse perspectives, <strong>Responsibility</strong> to ownership
of learning and <strong>Enthusiasm</strong> to pursue learning with joy and
collaborate with others.</p>
<p><strong>Growing Together as One SKPS Family</strong>
</p>
<p>Education is a collaborative endeavour, and the adage "it takes a village
to raise a child" has never been more relevant. I want to affirm and recognise
our staff's remarkable efforts in harnessing technology in administrative
processes and our teachers' professionalism in incorporating ICT-based
lessons and leveraging AI-enabled tools that have transformed our classrooms
into dynamic and interactive learning spaces. Our teachers have been skilful
in developing 21st Century Competencies through their thoughtful design
of learning experiences. At the heart of our school's ethos lies a deep-rooted
value of collaboration and connectedness to foster a positive learning
environment that is both caring and enabling.</p>
<p>We are deeply grateful to our parents for their unwavering partnership
and trust in our educational mission. Your support has been essential in
nurturing our SKLites' growth and success.</p>
<p>I am equally thankful for our partnerships with our School Advisory Committee
and community partners. Their commitment to working alongside our dedicated
and caring staff continues to enrich the educational experience we provide
for our SKLites.</p>
<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
</p>
<p>As we begin this new academic year, I am excited about the opportunity
to collaborate with all of you in creating innovative learning experiences.
Together, let us work to develop our SKLites into individuals who are not
only academically accomplished but also compassionate, resilient, and prepared
to make a meaningful impact in the world.</p>
<p>May you continue to reach new heights in your learning journey. Stay curious,
remain passionate, and never stop exploring new challenges to overcome.</p>
<p>I wish you a fulfilling and rewarding year ahead at Seng Kang Primary
School!</p>
