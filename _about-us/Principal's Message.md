Greetings and a warm welcome to Seng Kang Primary School!  
  
It is with much pride and excitement that the Seng Kang Primary family welcomes this brand new year as our school marks 25 years of founding in the community. The theme of our Silver Jubilee celebration, ***'Appreciate, Aspire and Achieve***' articulates the collective wish of our staff to appreciate the past contributions of past principals, staff and students, aspire to bring our school to greater heights and guide our students to achieve their goals and aspirations. As we reminisce our past, celebrate the present and anticipate our future in this milestone year, we invite our students, staff, alumni and stakeholders to celebrate this significant occasion with us as we seek to do our part to give back to the community. 
 
As school leadership changed hands over the past 25 years, we are proud that our school beliefs, 'Everyone Can Learn, Everyone Can Serve and Everyone is Special' remains enduring in the heart of every staff member. We believe that every child comes to us with his/her unique strengths and talents, it is our privilege and joy to discover the gem in each of them. It is our mission to bring out the best in every child and provide an inclusive learning environment where each child develops the confidence to strive and thrive in his/her own rights. Through our distinctive programmes, we have, over the past years, developed confident and effective communicators through our whole school approach to effective communication and nurtured many positive and healthy learners who went through our holistic character development and sports education programmes. As we forge head to ready students for the future, we aspire towards our vision to develop every student into an inventive thinker, who is curious and able to think critically, a confident leader capable of leading self and others and a gracious citizen who empathises and takes action to make a difference to community and the world.  

Amid the pandemic, we are grateful for our staff and students who have been adaptable, open-minded and resilient in the face of uncertainties and stood together as one Seng Kang Primary community to ensure that learning continues and school is safe for all. We appreciate our parents’ and partners’ kind understanding, unyielding support and confidence in the school processes. Moving ahead into the new normal, we seek to enhance the well-being our staff and strengthen their capabilities to enable them to lead and guide our students to scale new peaks of excellence. We look forward to continued support of the community and stakeholders as we embark on the next chapter of our history.  

May the year 2022 bring everyone good health, lots of positivity and bountiful blessings!   

Yours in Education,
<br>
