<p>Welcome to Seng Kang Primary School, where we nurture every SKLite to
become <strong>an inventive thinker, a confident leader, and a gracious citizen!</strong>
</p>
<p>Since our inception, we have remained true to our core beliefs that 'Everyone
can learn, Everyone can serve and Everyone is Special'. Our school crest
symbolises that each SKLite and staff member is a precious gem to be cherished
and developed. These enduring principles continue to form the foundation
of our educational philosophy.</p>
<p>In this rapidly evolving world, our aim is to cultivate SKLites who are
firmly rooted in values and adaptable to change. Throughout their six-year
primary education journey with us, we offer carefully curated, rich learning
opportunities and experiences. These are designed to instil our <strong>school values of graciousness, integrity, resilience, and confidence</strong>,
equipping our students to navigate their world effectively.</p>
<p>We are equally dedicated to enhancing our staff's well-being and strengthening
their capabilities. Our focus is on refining teaching and learning approaches
to be more intentional in enabling SKLites to learn through inquiry and
experiential learning. We encourage exploration of new areas of interest,
ensuring we remain current and relevant in a fast-changing global environment.</p>
<p>As we embark on this new academic year, we are excited to co-create innovative
learning experiences with our students, parents, and community partners.
This collaborative approach will allow us to tailor our educational offerings
to meet the evolving needs of our SKLites and prepare them for future challenges.</p>
<p>The adage "it takes a village to raise a child" rings true in our school
community. I am deeply grateful for the strong partnerships we have forged
with our parents, Parent Support Group (PSG), School Advisory Committee
(SAC), and community partners. Their commitment to journey alongside our
dedicated and caring staff is invaluable as we work together to develop
the <strong>refreshed four key learning dispositions (CORE)</strong>  <strong>in every SKLite:</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Curiosity</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Open-mindedness</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Responsibility</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Enthusiasm</strong>
</p>
<p>I wish you a fulfilling and rewarding experience with Seng Kang Primary
School as we co-create an exciting year of growth and learning ahead!</p>
