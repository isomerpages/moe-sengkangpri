<p><strong>Information Technology</strong>
</p>
<p>The ICT Club aims to promote interest among pupils on video technology,
develop teamwork, co-operation and leadership together with communication
skills among pupils and cultivate creativity and thinking skills in pupils
through various programmes and activities. Some activities we have include
animation workshops, robotics training and video production. These activities
are powerful educational tools that provide opportunities for pupils to
develop their critical thinking in this digital and media-rich age. Pupils
can become active and critical viewers and producers of films and videos
as they reflect on their roles and rights, learn to participate responsibly
and challenge their creativity.</p>
