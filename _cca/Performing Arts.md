**Synopsis**


**Modern Dance (Membership by school selection only)**

Dance members are selected on their physicality and co-ordination skills through an audition held annually for P2 and P3 pupils.. Beginning dancers will go through at least one year of foundation training before they can take part in competitions (Singapore Youth Festival/DanceWorks) They will however, still be selected to perform in school-based performances and public performances.

  

The objective of this CCA is to allow our pupils to appreciate a variety of dance genres and to develop their spatial awareness, positive social skills, discipline and resilience through dance. It is crucial for a young dancer to attend every session to instill discipline in the dancer and to ensure success of every dance performance.

  

**Malay Dance**  

The different Malay dance forms make up the multi-cultural mosaic that is Singapore. All pupils will go through an audition. Shortlisted pupils will be invited to join the CCA where they will explore the five basic Malay dance rhythms - Asli, Inang, Masri, Zapin, and Ronggeng (Joget) – while developing social awareness and relationship management. They will have a chance to represent the school in various competitions and performances such as Singapore Youth Festival.
