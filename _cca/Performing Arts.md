<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Modern Dance (Membership by school selection only)</strong>
</p>
<p>Dance members are selected on their physicality and co-ordination skills
through an audition held annually for P2 and P3 pupils.. Beginning dancers
will go through at least one year of foundation training before they can
take part in competitions (Singapore Youth Festival/DanceWorks) They will
however, still be selected to perform in school-based performances and
public performances.</p>
<p>The objective of this CCA is to allow our pupils to appreciate a variety
of dance genres and to develop their spatial awareness, positive social
skills, discipline and resilience through dance. It is crucial for a young
dancer to attend every session to instill discipline in the dancer and
to ensure success of every dance performance.</p>
<p><strong>Malay Dance</strong>
</p>
<p>The different Malay dance forms make up the multi-cultural mosaic that
is Singapore. All pupils will go through an audition. Shortlisted pupils
will be invited to join the CCA where they will explore the five basic
Malay dance rhythms - Asli, Inang, Masri, Zapin, and Ronggeng (Joget) â€“
while developing social awareness and relationship management. They will
have a chance to represent the school in various competitions and performances
such as Singapore Youth Festival.</p>
<p><strong>Handbells Ensemble (Membership by school selection only)</strong>
</p>
<p>Handbells Ensemble is a niche Performing Arts music instrumental CCA,
which aims to provide pupils with the experience and exposure to regular
performances. Pupils learn music theory and acquire a high level of discipline
and resilience through the regular practices. There are fun-filled Games
Day, an intensive camp, a Performing Arts concert. Pupils are selected
through formal auditions</p>
