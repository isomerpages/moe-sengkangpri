**Track and Field**

Calling all P3 to P6 pupils who can run Long Distance, Short Distance, do High or Long Jump or Shot Put. Track and Field is the CCA for you. With weekly training, endurance, agility and stamina will be built and you get to keep yourself fit and healthy. If you are very good, you get to represent the school in the Annual National Competition.

**Basketball (Girls)**

The Seng Kang Primary School Basketball CCA is one of our school’s (sports) niche CCA. Selected players with potential and good performance represent the school in the National Inter-Primary School Basketball Championships held annually. Basketball as a niche CCA has also helped talented pupils in their Direct School Admission into secondary schools of their choice.

  

**Hockey (Boys/Girls)~(Membership by school selection only)**

The hockey team from SKPS was formed in January 2011. Under the guidance of the dedicated teachers and the passionate coach, SKPS Hockey team has been performing well and improving over the past few years. The Junior Girls team 2016 had achieved excellent result by clinching the championship for the National Hockey Tournament, adding to the sporting accolades of the school. For the same year, both the Senior Boys and Girls teams achieved the 2nd runner up position. The same teams also achieved championship for the North Zone Inter-Primary Hockey Tournament in 2016. Besides imparting and equipping the necessary hockey skills to help them become confident players, we also look into instilling important values such as resilience, integrity, respect, sportsmanship and fair play in our pupils. Mission: To inculcate positive living values and help each child to grow and develop his individual potential in hockey.  

**Softball CCA**  

Softball is a game that challenges not only the techniques of the players, but also on their ability to make effective decisions in split seconds. It builds both the physical and mental strength of the players. In SKPS Softball, the teachers and coaches focuses on character building as well. We believe that beyond the wins and losses, we want to build a team of young athletes who are upright in character, possess positive attitudes and exhibit good sportsmanship.
