<p><strong>Basketball (Girls)</strong>

<p>The Seng Kang Primary School Basketball CCA is one of our school’s sports
niche CCA. Selected players with potential and good performance will get
to represent the school in the National Inter-Primary School Basketball
Championships held annually. Basketball has also helped talented pupils
in their Direct School Admission into secondary schools of their choice.</p>
<p><strong>Hockey (Boys/Girls)~(Membership by school selection only)</strong>
</p>
<p>Under the guidance of the dedicated teachers and the passionate coach.
Besides imparting and equipping the necessary hockey skills to help them
become confident players, we also look into instilling important values
such as resilience, integrity, respect, sportsmanship and fair play in
our pupils. Mission: To inculcate positive living values and help each
child to grow and develop his individual potential in hockey.</p>
<p><strong>Softball CCA</strong>
</p>
<p>Softball is a game that challenges not only the techniques of the players,
but also on their ability to make effective decisions in split seconds.
It builds both the physical and mental strength of the players. In SKPS
Softball, the teachers and coaches focuses on character building as well.
We believe that beyond the wins and losses, we want to build a team of
young athletes who are upright in character, possess positive attitudes
and exhibit good sportsmanship.</p>
