our pupils. Mission: To inculcate positive living values and help each
child to grow and develop his individual potential in hockey.</p>
<p><strong>Softball CCA</strong>
</p>
<p>Softball is a game that challenges not only the techniques of the players,
but also on their ability to make effective decisions in split seconds.
It builds both the physical and mental strength of the players. In SKPS
Softball, the teachers and coaches focuses on character building as well.
We believe that beyond the wins and losses, we want to build a team of
young athletes who are upright in character, possess positive attitudes
and exhibit good sportsmanship.</p>
