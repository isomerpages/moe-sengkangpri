The overall approach to Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is encapsulated in the framework shown below. The 5 domains in which the pupils in Seng Kang Primary school are developed and thus show competence in is reflected in the framework. All pupils will be given enough opportunities to develop experience and reflect on what has been taught.

The domains are supported by the ‘2 CARE’ Framework. The school ensures that each pillar is supported by the aspects of how the Culture it wants to set in place and how that is determined, the Curriculum that drives the programmes, the Assessment that is used to determine if the learning has taken place, the Relationship (partnerships) that are established in the process and finally if Enterprise (Innovation) is applied when structuring the approach. These determining factors are suggested by Thomas Lickona on his views onn what a good school should do to accomplish a well-rounded Character Programme.
