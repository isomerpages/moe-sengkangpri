<p>These provide opportunities for students to deepen their appreciation
of our shared past and Singaporeâ€™s current realities. Through differentiated
Level-wide NE learning experiences, our school seeks to nurture a strong
a sense of belonging, a sense of hope, a sense of reality and a strong
will in our SKLites to act as citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides school-wide
commemoration, schools are to conduct the CCE (FTGP) lessons related to
NE Commemorative Days. In addition, contemporary content would be provided
for students through Kindsville Times/A-Ok.</p>
