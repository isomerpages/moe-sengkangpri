<p>&nbsp;Our school provides enriching opportunities for students to deepen
their appreciation of Singapore’s shared history and contemporary realities.
Through differentiated, level-wide National Education (NE) learning experiences,
we aim to nurture in our SKLites a strong sense of belonging, hope, and
reality, as well as the resilience to act as responsible citizens.</p>
<p>Beyond school-wide NE commemorative events, Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) lessons during Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) are
tailored to reinforce these themes. Students are also exposed to contemporary
content through engaging platforms such as Kindsville Times and A-OK, ensuring
they stay informed and inspired.</p>
<p>Together, we cultivate a generation of compassionate and civic-minded
individuals who contribute meaningfully to Singapore’s future.</p>
