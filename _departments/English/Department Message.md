The English Department is a team of reflective practitioners and life-long learners. We equip our students with future skills to be a confident, effective and responsible communicator through our Whole School Approach to Effective Communication in English approach. We challenge and encourage our students to question, reflect and explore possibilities through collaboration with their peers.
