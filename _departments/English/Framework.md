**Approach to EL Teaching** <br>
We believe that language is acquired through reading and frequent use, hence we provide an array of programmes to promote reading and speaking. We provide many opportunities for pupils to read good books, listen to stories and voice their opinions orally and in writing. We also provide various platforms to allow our pupils to use language confidently and creatively through performances and competitions. We hope to develop our pupils holistically so that they can use Internationally Acceptable English with confidence and manage information responsibly. Based on these beliefs, we have adopted a Whole- School Approach to Effective Communication in English (WSA-EC) focusing on reading and speaking.<br>
