**Library Fortnight:** Reading is an integral part of our students’ learning of EL. In SKPS, the school library is themed ‘Storyland’ where hundreds of books await to be read and to fuel the imagination of our students. Hence, the annual Library Fortnight with 

its array of book related activities promote and sustain the love of, and joy in, reading for the students.
