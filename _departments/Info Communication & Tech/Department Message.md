The Information & Communication Technology (ICT) Department is committed in equipping our students with the 21st Century Competencies (21CC). Our students are introduced specific values education and ICT skills at appropriate stages of their education. With the Internet Revolution, information is often literally just a click away. We challenge and encourage our students to know what questions to ask, how to sieve information and extract information that is relevant and useful. At the same time, they need to be discerning so that they can shield themselves from harm, while adopting ethical practices in cyberspace.
