**Approach to use of ICT in Teaching and Learning**

  

The school adopts a whole-school approach in preparing our students to acquire the skills in the areas of Baseline ICT Standards (New Media Literacies) Skills and Cyber Wellness (collaboration with the CCE Department) in an ICT-enriched environment. Every student would undergo Baseline ICT Standards Programme during their 6-year education in the school. The Baseline ICT Standards is a set of ICT skill competencies set out in the Learning Outcomes under the New Media Literacies Programme. These represent the basic level of knowledge, skills and values that pupils need in order to fully benefit from a curriculum enriched with ICT, and eventually thrive in a technology-driven society. Included in the standards are two critical cyber wellness areas of skills and values, namely, ethical and legal use, and safe and responsible use. The school also uses the Student Learning Space (SLS), an online learning platform that contains curriculum-aligned resources and learning tools to support teaching and learning.
