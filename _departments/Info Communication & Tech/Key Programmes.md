**P5 Code For Fun Programme (CFF)**

Code for Fun (CFF) seeks to expose our P5 students to learn Computational Thinking through coding. The students will participate in a 10-hour enrichment programme conducted in school. Through this programme, they will develop an appreciation of core computational thinking and coding concepts through simple visual programming-based lessons co-developed by MOE and IMDA. They would also be exposed to emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence.
