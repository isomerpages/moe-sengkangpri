In Seng Kang Primary School, all Mother Tongue Language (MTL) teachers strives to work towards a vision of nurturing Active Learners and Proficient Users of the MTL. We envision a future that all our students will enjoy learning MTL and use it on a daily basis. With the right support and encouragement, our students will be able to communicate confidently in MTL and use it to interact with their friends, family members and community. Besides knowing how to communicate in MTL, we also aim to create opportunities for our students to learn and appreciate their local ethnic culture, customs and traditions.
