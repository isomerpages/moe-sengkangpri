**_Mother Tongue Fortnight_**

Mooted in 2011, this 2-week long event is a platform for students to actively learn the MTL, to kindle students’ interest to use MTL and experience it as “living languages”. During the Mother Tongue Fortnight, students will be given the opportunities to participate in cultural activities. The MTL department organized fun and cultural activities for all levels from P1-P6 during the MT Fortnight Week. The students will learn valuable information about the local culture and will also have exciting hands-on activities.
