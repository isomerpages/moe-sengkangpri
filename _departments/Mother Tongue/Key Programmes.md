**_Mother Tongue Fortnight_**

Mooted in 2011, this 2-week long event is a platform for students to actively learn the MTL, to kindle students’ interest to use MTL and experience it as “living languages”. During the Mother Tongue Fortnight, students will be given the opportunities to participate in cultural activities. The MTL department organized fun and cultural activities for all levels from P1-P6 during the MT Fortnight Week. The students will learn valuable information about the local culture and will also have exciting hands-on activities.

**_Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Reading Programme_**

The MTL Reading Programme is a school based curriculum aimed at promoting a reading culture in SKPS through structured curriculum reading periods, morning reading on every Thursday, reading cum reflection journals and various reading activities for all students. The reading of MTL stories, many of which are rich in cultural content, would in turn engender a love for the language and culture.

In addition, the MTL Reading Day is organised once every year to promote reading of Mother Tongue storybooks amongst pupils, as well as to increase their confidence in using their own Mother Tongue.

  

Interactive and fun activities were planned to encourage pupils to read MTL storybooks. These include exhibition of students’ work; a prize redemption booth for pupils to redeem prizes based on the number of books read recorded in their own reading logs.
