The Aesthetics Department is made up of the Art and Music units, and consists of educators who are passionate about the arts and helping students develop their passion and interest through the arts. The department adopts a spiraled curriculum approach that integrates CCE level outcomes, level themes and thematic cultural exposure, to develop aesthetic skills, values and 21st-century competencies (21CC).

  

**_Physical Education (PE)_**

Rationale

A physically educated person is one who not only has the head knowledge of skillsets to stay healthy, but also has the motivation to and actually executes the necessary skillsets to stay healthy. Holistic Physical Education (HoPE) was developed to impart these attributes to the students in order that they are able and willing to lead a healthy lifestyle in and out of school, and eventually make it a lifelong endeavour.
