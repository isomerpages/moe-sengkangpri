**Approach and Deployment of LLP**

Delivered through a Sport Education Model (Source: Siedentop, D, “Sports education: Quality PE through positive sport experiences”, 1994), sport is defined as playful competition, or termed otherwise as "play education". The LLP not only gives students the physical activity and the opportunity to play, but also targets the building of the social-emotional competencies as well. For instance, students will learn how to socialise, take turns, manage self, and be able to compete in a competitive and yet, safe environment through structured play. The concept lies in learning more about SEL naturally from play rather than from reading a rule book and being told what to do by teachers. Hence, students will be able to practice responsible personal behaviour in a physical activity setting and demonstrate the ability to work with others. These platforms also serve as an extension to the Programme for Active Learning (PAL) conducted in Primary One and Two.

  

They will also be given more opportunities to be more adept at conflict management. Other benefits outside of SEL would be the ability to identify potential dangers and identify safe alternatives when pursuing physical activities. Setting goals and working independently, described in the programme outline below, in pursuit of personal fitness and skill development would be a natural by-product of the programme.

  

Opportunities are also provided for students to showcase their musical and artistic talents through tiered platforms. With the objective of developing students’ confidence in themselves, nurturing their interests and developing their talents, these platforms allow students to experience performing and showcasing their artistic talents to others beyond their classroom. Students are also activated as learning resources for each other.

  

**PLC**

The students underwent mental and physical activities, which help draw parallels with the struggles that they will face in the future. The students worked in a multiracial group, tapping on the strength of each member to reach an objective. This is much like living in a community. The chosen activities also encourages the love of outdoor physical activity to promote a healthy lifestyle.

  

The lower primary students had a parent-teacher-student activity which represents the strong bonds the school has with the community.

  

There are aesthetic elements comprising of Art and Music stations where pupils will be able to participate in and appreciate the arts for a truly holistic life.

The Art department organised art competitions for the lower primary students while the upper primary students did a combination of collaborative art works to be displayed around the school. The effort is to signify community bonds, racial harmony and our strength in unity.

  

The Music department provided an opportunity for students to explore creativity in instrument and music making by having students make their own equipment and making music with their instruments. A mass dance was conducted for the Primary 5 students, this gave students a chance to build confidence in their own talent and accept one another’s strength and weakness.

**_Art & Music_**

  

**Southeast Asian Music Programme:** With Southeast Asian music as one of the foci of the P3 and P4 Music curriculum, students learn and experience the music and culture of Malaysia and Indonesia through the P3 Ethnic Malay Dance and the P4 Angklung programmes. While the P3 Ethnic Malay Dance programme highlights the four main ethnic Malay rhythms of Malay Dance in Singapore and Malaysia, the P4 Angklung programme introduces the Angklung as an Indonesian traditional cultural instrument and a form of performing arts.

  

Through these programmes, students learnt about the history and cultural roots of Southeast Asian music whilst learning to appreciate the art forms. The Primary 4s rounded up the P4 Angklung programme with captivating renditions of a variety of Southeast Asian pieces, such as Loy Krathong and Planting Rice, on the Angklung.

**Global Music Programme:** Under the guidance of skilled music teachers, the P5 students learn to play cultural ethnic percussion instruments, such as the jidur, dhol and da gu, which are uncommon in their daily lives. Coupled with learning to handle and playing the instruments, the learning experiences help to guide students in gaining a deeper understanding of how cultural practices and art forms migrate and influence the musical landscape of Singapore. Rounding up the module, students presented combined-class recess performances featuring a multi-cultural fusion of ethnic percussions and modern-day Orff instruments with renditions of Chan Mali Chan and Sakura.

**Exhibited Works @ NLB:** Having partnered the National Library Board (NLB) since 2013 for annual exhibitions and student-led workshops, Seng Kang Primary is no stranger to the Seng Kang Public Library. This partnership provides a platform for students to exhibit their artworks in public, bolstering students' confidence in art-making and motivates them to further their interest and passion for the visual arts. Through the organised workshops in the library in recent years, opportunities were also given to students to facilitate community-based workshops for the public, thereby further enriching their learning experience through serving the community with their skills.

**Learning for Life Programme (LLP)**

Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is entitled, “Developing Values and Leadership through Sports Education”.

Through the programme, the school aims to develop students who are able to:

1.  Exhibit desirable personal and social behaviour that respects self and others in individual and team sports settings;
2.  Demonstrate our four school values and leadership when participating in individual and team sports settings; and
3.  Value individual and team sports for health, enjoyment, challenge, self-expression and social interaction purposes;

**Intervention Programme**

Low-ability (LA) PE intervention programme started in 2nd semester of 2016. It received positive feedback from teachers. The programme is designed to identify pupils who are behind their peer or age group in gross development skills. The programme is targeted to P1 & P3 as it is the foundation years for gross development skills. The main gross development skills is made of locomotor skills such as gallop and object control skills such as striking and throwing. These pupils will be supported by an Allied Educator (PE) in the main lesson to plan and scaffold the lesson for the pupils. The use of IPAD and online application called Coach’s eye was used to provide immediate feedback for the pupils so that they evaluate their performance and improve on their weakness and the teacher is able to modified the next lesson for the pupils.
