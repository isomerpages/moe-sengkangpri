_**Our key programmes are as follows:**_

  

**P3 Interdisciplinary Project Work: Boat making**

The P3 students observe and reflect on how materials are used in contemporary artwork. During the process, they learn how to differentiate between the kinds of materials that they often use and choose materials with suitable properties for their boats. They also learn to empathise with how pollution impacts the environment. Students then use recyclables to make a boat that can float and move. They learn to work together as a group to create and test their boats and overcome challenges together. They also have the opportunity to display their confidence while presenting in their groups to their classmates.
