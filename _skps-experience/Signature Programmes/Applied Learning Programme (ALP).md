The English Language Department of Seng Kang Primary believes in providing our students with opportunities to develop as confident and effective communication skills. Hence the school’s Applied Learning Programmes (ALP) is rightly named as ‘Enhance Spoken English Language Programme’. Our students experience modules in spoken language in a spiral and tiered  progression to enhance and build their skills in EL communication.

The AP modules are as follows:

**Primary 1 Poetry Recitation & Jingles & Primary 2 Storytelling**

Our programmes look at developing our P1 and P2 students in areas of voice projection, proper performance posture, correct pronunciation and pace of speech. At P3 and P4 they put into practice skills picked up at lower primary for the Readers’ Theatre modules. 

To practise their oral skills through free expression and voicing of opinions on current affairs, our primary 3 and 4 students read articles from the Little Red Dot and some primary 4, all of primary 5 and 6 students read What’s Up newspapers. The students are made to write their response to an article, using thinking routines, so that they not only become confident but effective too in their expression of thought, word and speech.  Our more competent users of EL take part in various competitive platforms to benchmark their skills with their peers in cluster, zonal and national arenas.
