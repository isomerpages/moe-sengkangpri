**OVERVIEW**

The Character Education Approach in the school is pinned on 2 approaches to help the school achieve its Vision and Mission.  Based on the principles of Thomas Lickona on how to develop a good character education programme, we focus on five parameters to ensure that our Character Education is well thought through.  The domains we look at each area is the Curriculum that drives the domain, the Culture that we want to achieve, the relevant Assessment to measure the programmes, the Relationships that can push the programme and finally Innovative Practices that we can use if programmes are adopted or replicated.

**CHARACTER EDUCATION - VALUES EDUCATION**

Using the Kolhberg and Piaget theories of moral development and cognitive development respectively as a reference, the Lifeskills curriculum has been explicitly designed to impart values to students in the formal education system. It also aims at enhancing the daily **Value Moment Programme**. The syllabus is a more student-centric approach, teaching the pupils to develop the school core values in them and to display these values in their actions and behaviour. Pupils are taught how to identify the behaviour they should emulate in order to become a more upright individual and eventually a concerned citizen. They are also taught to reflect on the right and wrong actions and learn from their own reflection. To ensure that the current nation centric value education is not lost, the curriculum has infused.

**CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION**

National Education (N.E), Cyberwellness and Kindness Movement (SKM) as well as the Values in Education (VIA) into the syllabus. This is to ensure that pupils learn that the values and behaviour they display do not just affect them but the nation as a whole in the long run. The curriculum thus aides in developing them to be gracious citizens, one of the school missions. The Celebration of the core NE Events is deepened with the introduction of Contemporary Issues for the blocks in the Upper Primary to deepen the conversations amongst the children
