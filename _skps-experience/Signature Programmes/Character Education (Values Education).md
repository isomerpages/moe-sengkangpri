**OVERVIEW**

The Character Education Approach in the school is pinned on 2 approaches to help the school achieve its Vision and Mission.  Based on the principles of Thomas Lickona on how to develop a good character education programme, we focus on five parameters to ensure that our Character Education is well thought through.  The domains we look at each area is the Curriculum that drives the domain, the Culture that we want to achieve, the relevant Assessment to measure the programmes, the Relationships that can push the programme and finally Innovative Practices that we can use if programmes are adopted or replicated.
