Welcome to Seng Kang Primary School where every SKLite is an inventive thinker, a confident leader, and a gracious citizen!

It is my privilege to have the opportunity to lead Seng Kang Primary School and I would like to express my appreciation to my predecessor, Mrs Teo Whye Choo for her six years of leadership. Last year, our school celebrated our Silver Jubilee since the founding of the school in 1997. Throughout the years, we remain steadfast in our school beliefs that ‘Everyone can learn, Everyone can serve and Everyone is Special’. Our school crest symbolizes that every SKLite and every staff is a gem to be treasured and nurtured. These enduring beliefs will continue to be the cornerstones in our educational philosophy.

In this fast-changing world, we want to develop our SKLites to be grounded in values and be adaptive in the face of change. Through their six years of primary education with us and from the rich learning opportunities and experiences which we have curated for them, they will develop the school values of graciousness, integrity, resilience, and confidence to help them navigate the world they are in.  

We are equally committed to enhance the well-being of our staff and to strengthen their capabilities to enable them to spearhead innovation and guide our SKLites to explore new areas of interests so that we continue to stay current and relevant in a fast-evolving world environment.

As the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child. I look forward to the partnership with our parents, our Parent Support Group (PSG), School Advisory Committee (SAC) and community partners to journey with my team of dedicated and caring staff to develop the five key learning dispositions in every SKLite: Curiosity, Open-mindedness, Responsibility, Resilience and Enthusiasm (COR2E).

May 2023 brings us and our families good health, a fulfilling and rewarding experience!

Your partner-in-education,

Mrs Tan Siew Hong
